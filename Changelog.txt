Changelog of Pythia:

Version 2.2.0
  - New Feature #17: Pythia now supports Oracle Database 21c as well as Multitenant / Container Databases
    
    Especially the support for Multitenant Databases has brought some Changes.
    It's now necessary to provide the information if the Databases running on a
    specific RDBMS is a CDB or not. It's not a real good implementation to control
    this in the rdbms_dict.yml cause the fact if it is a CDB or not, is defined per
    database and not per RDBMS. But since 21c no longer supports any NON-CDB setups,
    we implemented it there. The fact if is a CDB or not is controlled by setting
    the variable container_database within rdbms_dict.yml.
    Second major adjustment can be found during the patching of a container database.
    You can control if you want to get all PDBs within a CDB started up after the
    patch has been applied to the RDBMS by using the variable patch_all_pdbs within
    the patch_dict.yml. Keep in mind, this variable is optional within the dictionary,
    so you can specify it but you don't have to. When the variable patch_all_pdbs is
    set to false, only PDBs that are started up during CDB startup (by using a trigger) are
    opened and therefore patched.
    When you missed the point for patching all PDBs while patching a CDB with Pythia,
    you have to patch the PDBs (by using datapatch) manually on your own. Pythia will
    not know if there are PDBs not patched.
